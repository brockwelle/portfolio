    <p>I’m a Geographer living in Peoria, IL. I enjoy traveling, rowing, and drawing. I’m also interested in innovation
      and systemic process improvement. Most of all, I love spending time with my three cats and new granddaughter.</p>
    <img src="../assets/images/alqasr_metropol.jpg" alt="portrait painting" height="160px">
    <p>In addition to the US, I've lived and worked in ...
    <ul>
      <li>Kazakhstan</li>
      <li>Iraq</li>
      <li>Jordan</li>
      <li>Qatar</li>
      <li>Thailand</li>
    </ul>
    ... solving real world problems, including: how to get oil out of the North Caspian Sea
    and the Gulf of Thailand with the least negative impact to environment/community/safety; how to clean
    up the Gulf of Mexico during/after an oil spill; how to increase the amount of water available to rebuild
    the agriculture sector in Iraq; and how to build/maintain better maps using machine learning [ML] to navigate
    autonomous vehicles.

    <p>What would you do if you couldn't fail?</p>
