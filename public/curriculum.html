            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <img src="../assets/images/ewb_social.jpg" height=200 alt="social profile photo eric brockwell"></img>
            <p>Currently taking a sabbatical for intentional thinking about what comes next. More recently, helping GM transition from a culture of thinking and delivering like an automotive
                manufacturer to a culture of being a Software Enabled Services Platform provider, I led software
                innovation teams working on GM Mobile Apps used by millions. I modeled professional behavior while
                developing/promoting a psychologically safe space and I focused on helping others through change and
                facilitating periods of transition. Both professionally and personally, I work to reduce negative
                impacts of anthropogenic and technical progress on the environment, society, and individuals; and I
                always work to transfer valuable skills/experience to internationals/locals, newer workers, and
                students.</p>
            <p>Previously an AI/ML Software Development Manager, Geomatics Engineer, and GIS Administrator/DBA/Developer
                with experience in most aspects of geospatial and IT as they relate to the environmental protection and
                Oil & Gas E&P industries. Equally capable in planning, executing and completing projects whether working
                solo, as a team member, or as the project manager/team lead. Experienced at using both proven and
                creative methods for developing solutions to data and database problems, designing web applications and
                desktop software extensions/customizations and leading both small and large teams across disparate
                locations to do the same. Communicated regularly with customers, end users, data stewards, and mid-level
                managers for the purposes of assessing needs, defining requirements, coding applications, and providing
                user support.</p>
